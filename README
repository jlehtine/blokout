README
======

This is the source code distribution of Blokout, an open source
Blockout clone featuring 3D OpenGL graphics. If you don't know the
original Blockout it could be shortly described as 3D Tetris. If you
don't know Tetris either, you have completely missed one famous
computer game genre based on falling blocks. If this is the case, I
would recommend you to try any of the numerous Tetris clones
available.

Blokout was originally written as an assignment work for the Helsinki
University of Technology course Tik-111.300 Computer Graphics. For
more information about the authors, see AUTHORS file.

Blokout code is available as a GitHub repository [1] and there is also
a web site [2] providing source code packages and pre-compiled binaries.

INSTALLATION
------------

Blokout uses GNU Autotools for configuring the build environment and
creating makefiles.

If you are using the source code repository directly, then first make
sure you have Autotools available and execute shell command './autogen.sh'.
If you are using the source code distribution package then you may skip
this phase because the package already contains a configuration script.

Then you may configure and build the package using the standard procedure.
See generic instructions in INSTALL file.

You will need installed OpenGL libraries (or you can use Mesa) and
GLUT (or Freeglut) libraries. You must also have X11 development
environment installed.

To cross-compile this software for Windows using a GNU/Linux development
environment and MinGW, see instructions in INSTALL.mingw_cross.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME
-------------------------

To find short instructions for the game, see INSTRUCTIONS file.


STATUS
------

Blokout is not being actively developed by the original authors but as
it is open source software, anyone can continue development, add new
features and fix bugs (and sort out messy source code :). If you want
to make your modifications available through the Blokout repository or
web site then make a pull request in GitHub or contact Johannes Lehtinen
(contact information available in AUTHORS).
