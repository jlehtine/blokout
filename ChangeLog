2006-03-31 v0.1.1

    Added support for cross-compiling BlokOut for Microsoft Windows using
    Mingw for compilation. This was mainly due to people asking for a
    precompiled Windows version but also so that I could learn about
    using Mingw.

2000-10-07 v0.1

	The first publicly released version. No significant modifications,
	just packaged the software for distribution and added some
	documentation. Most probably BlokOut wouldn't have been released
	at all if it was not for people asking me when it would be
	available :)

	The BlokOut was submitted as an assignment work for the Helsinki
