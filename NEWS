This is the first public release of BlokOut. It could also be the last
one because BlokOut is not maintained by the original authors who are
too busy with other projects. However, as the full source code is
available, it is up to other developers to continue development
if they so wish. There are still lots of clitches and unfinished
code in BlokOut. And nothing stops you from adding new features (like
two player game where players would be throwing blocks toward each
other).
