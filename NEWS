This is the first public release of BlokOut. It could also be the last
one because BlokOut is not being developed by the original authors who
are too busy with other projects. However, as the full source code is
available, it is up to other developers to continue development if
they so wish. There are still lots of bugs and unfinished code in
BlokOut. And nothing stops you from adding new features (like two
player game where players would be throwing blocks toward each other).

If you want to make your modifications and fixes available through the
current Blokout WWW page, please contact me.
