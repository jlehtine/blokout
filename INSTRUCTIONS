This file includes very short instructions to play BlokOut. I assume
here that you already know the idea behind original Blockout.
Otherwise, you have to find it out yourself :)


NAVIGATING THE MENUS

The menu system is somewhat awkward as you have to control it using
keyboard rather than just clicking with your mouse. The arrow keys
will move the selection bar up/down and selections are made by
pressing ENTER. In the options menu, the option values are changed by
pressing right arrow key. You can back up to upper level menu by
pressing ESC.

There are also few shortcuts in menus like 'N' to start a new game.


KEYBOARD CONTROLS DURING GAME

The following keys are used to control falling block. Please let me
know if these controls are incorrect compared to the original
Blockout.

  e, d    rotate block around x-axis
  w, s    rotate block around y-axis
  q, a    rotate block around z-axis
  F1-F3   select different view point
  t       shortcut to set sidebar textures on/off
  y       show/hide sidebar
  arrows  move the block around in plane
  ESC     pause the game and enter menu system

You can also use mouse to rotate your viewpoint.


HIGHSCORES

A simple highscore list is maintained in a file ~/.blokout.hs. This
file is machine architecture dependent which may cause trouble if you
share your home directory among several platforms and would like to
play Blokout on all of them. In this case, you can use environment
variable BLOKOUT_HIGHSCORE to select filename for the highscore file.


LOW END GRAPHICS EQUIPMENT

If you don't have real 3D equipment (for example you are using Mesa
with only software support for OpenGL) you probably want to switch off
textures and transparent surfaces to be able to really play the game.
You can do this in settings menu.
